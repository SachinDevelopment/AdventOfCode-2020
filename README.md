# AdventOfCode-2020

I will be using javascript...Figure it might teach me a thing or two for my work at Olive...I'll get more adventurous next year. Feel free to fork this repo if you are planning to use javascript. I will just copy the day-num folder everyday before I begin work.

### Dependencies:
[NodeJS LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

### Running:

This installs all the necessary packages. npm is automatically installed with node.

```bash
npm install
```

Then to run the solution for any given day where x is the day

```bash
node src/day-x/index.js
```
